# Delay.js

Delay.js is a JavaScript tool that allows a developer to establish a minimum amount of time that must pass prior to executing one or more callbacks. This tool is especially useful for delaying a quick AJAX response that may otherwise cause a spinner to flash on/off, or something to that nature. This software is designed to be >=IE11 compatible.
